# Hexagonal Architecture (6AS) Service Template for Go

Archetype for Hexagonal Architecture Service (6AS)

Hexagonal architecture, also known as the Ports and Adapters pattern, is a software architectural pattern that promotes a clear separation of concerns by organizing the application into three main layers: the domain, the application, and the infrastructure. The central idea is to make the domain layer, which contains the business logic, independent of external systems or interfaces. To achieve this, hexagonal architecture uses ports to define the inputs and outputs of the system and adapters to handle the communication between the application and external elements. By isolating the core business logic from external dependencies, hexagonal architecture enables a more maintainable, testable, and scalable system.
