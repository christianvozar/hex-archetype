A repository interface is a component that defines a contract for data access and persistence, isolating the domain layer from the specific details of data storage technology. The repository interface is part of the domain layer and is responsible for abstracting the retrieval and persistence of domain entities, allowing the core business logic to remain agnostic of the underlying data storage mechanism.

The repository interface provides a set of methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) domain entities, as well as any other necessary operations for querying and managing the entities. By defining an interface, you can implement multiple concrete repository implementations that use different storage technologies (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, in-memory storage, etc.) without affecting the domain layer.

## Example

```
package repository

import "context"

type UserRepository interface {
    CreateUser(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    GetUserByID(ctx context.Context, id int64) (*User, error)
    UpdateUser(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    DeleteUser(ctx context.Context, id int64) error
    ListUsers(ctx context.Context) ([]*User, error)
}
```

In this example, the UserRepository interface defines methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users, as well as listing all users. Concrete implementations of this interface will handle the actual data persistence using a specific storage technology, while the domain layer remains decoupled from these details.
